Java Concurrency and Synchronization

Description:
This project is a Java implementation of a simplified version of the game "Set," focusing on concurrent programming and synchronization. The game involves multiple players attempting to identify sets of cards with matching or differing features. The project includes handling player threads, game logic, and synchronization to ensure thread safety and proper game flow. The primary goal is to practice concurrent programming, thread management, and synchronization techniques in Java.

Skills Required:

Programming Languages: Java
Concepts and Techniques: Concurrent programming, thread management, synchronization, game logic implementation.
Tools and Libraries: Java Concurrency utilities, Maven for build automation.
Development Practices: Implementing synchronization mechanisms, ensuring thread safety, efficient use of concurrency features, writing and running unit tests.
